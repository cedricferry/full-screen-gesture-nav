# Full Screen Gesture Nav

PoC to demo full screen gesture navigation in Android

Shows three screens using system bar behaviours `BEHAVIOR_SHOW_TRANSIENT_BARS_BY_SWIPE` and `BEHAVIOR_SHOW_BARS_BY_SWIPE`

This is an attempt to achieve full screen behaviour where swipe back gestures are ignored, and swipes from the top and bottom of the screen cause motion events ending with a `ACTION_CANCEL`.
